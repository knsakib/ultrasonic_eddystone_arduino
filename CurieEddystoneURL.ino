/*
 * Eddystone URL for Arduino/Genuino 101.
 * 
 * This is an Intel Curie Eddystone-compatible Sketch
 * (https://github.com/google/eddystone).
 * 
 * The Eddystone BLE protocol is used by the Physical Web(tm) project
 * (https://github.com/google/physical-web).
 * The Physical Web project is about BLE beacons that broadcast URLs
 * so your users don't have to download an app just to interact with
 * your device.
 * 
 * Note: this version doesn't support Eddystone Config mode.
 * To change the URL, you need to modify MY_URL and reload the Arduino.
 * 
 * Parts required:
 *   Arduino/Genuino 101.  This Sketch runs only on Curie-based devices.
 *   No other hardware is required.
 * 
 * To Use:
 * - Setup your CurieBLE libraries to support Eddystone.
 *   Doing this may be a little complicated until the Eddystone support
 *   is added to the CurieBLE library.  Until then...
 *   There are two ways to do that:
 *   1) Pull code from https://github.com/bneedhamia/corelibs-arduino101/tree/support-eddystone-url
 *   or
 *   2) Replace CurieBLE/BLEPeripheral.* and CurieBLE/keywords.txt 
 *   with a modified version that supports Eddystone Advertising packets.
 *   See https://github.com/bneedhamia/CurieBLEServiceData
 *   once that's done...
 * - Set MY_URL to the url for the beacon you wish to broadcast.
 * - Download this Sketch to an Arduino/Genuino 101.
 * - Download a Physical Web app to your phone.
 *   For example, Google's Physical Web Android app is at
 *   https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=physical_web.org.physicalweb

/*
 * Note: as of this writing, the documentation of the CurieBLE library
 * is the library source, at (on Linux)
 * ~/.arduino15/packages/Intel/hardware/arc32/1.0.4/libraries/CurieBle/src
 * 
 * Version 1.0.4 of CurieBle doesn't support Eddystone-format
 * BLE Advertising packets, for 2 reasons:
 * - It uses the BLE code for Incomplete Service UUID list
 *   instead of Complete Service UUID list code required by Eddystone.
 * - It doesn't support Service Data, which is required by Eddystone.
 * 
 * Note: the name of the Curie BLE library changed between 1.0.4 and
 * the latest (as of March 10, 2016) version:
 * In 1.0.4, the name is CurieBle.h; in later versions, it's CurieBLE.h
